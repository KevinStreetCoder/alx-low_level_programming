* 0x02-functions_nested_loops *
This directory contains C programs that demonstrate the use of functions and nested loops in programming. These programs were written as part of the curriculum for the low-level programming and algorithm specialization in ALX.

List of files
The following files are included in this directory:

0-holberton.c - A program that prints "Holberton" followed by a new line.
1-alphabet.c - A program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.
2-print_alphabet_x10.c - A program that prints the alphabet in lowercase ten times, each followed by a new line.
3-islower.c - A function that checks for lowercase characters.
4-isalpha.c - A function that checks for alphabetic characters.
5-sign.c - A function that prints the sign of a number.
6-abs.c - A function that computes the absolute value of an integer.
7-print_last_digit.c - A function that prints the last digit of a number.
8-24_hours.c - A function that prints every minute of the day of Jack Bauer, starting from 00:00 to 23:59.
9-times_table.c - A function that prints the 9 times table, starting with 0.
10-add.c - A function that adds two integers and returns the result.
11-print_to_98.c - A function that prints all natural numbers from a given number up to 98.
100-times_table.c - A function that prints the n times table, starting with 0, where n is a given integer.
101-natural.c - A program that computes and prints the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1024.
102-fibonacci.c - A program that prints the first 50 Fibonacci numbers, starting with 1 and 2.
103-fibonacci.c - A program that finds and prints the sum of the even-valued terms of the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed 4,000,000.
holberton.h - The header file containing the function prototypes.
How to use
To compile these programs, you must have the gcc compiler installed on your machine. Run the following command in your terminal:

php
Copy code
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic <filename.c> -o <output filename>
Replace <filename.c> with the name of the file you want to compile, and <output filename> with the name you want to give to the compiled program.

To run the program, type the following command in your terminal:

javascript
Copy code
./<output filename>
Replace <output filename> with the name of the compiled program.
